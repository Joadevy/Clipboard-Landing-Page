## Overview
This is my solution to the [Clipboard landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). 

### The challenge

- Reply the design of the component as well as possible and make it responsive for 375px and 1440px resolutions.

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS for nesting, module and custom properties.

### What I learned

This is my first complete landing page coded 100% for me. In my past projects I did small components for web pages and at this landing I integrated all of my knowledge and did some components in the same layout.
Also on this project I learned more about SASS. I used it to nesting and mainly in order to module my code. I used a pattern to organize the project like an architecture but adapted for this small web.
I'll keep working on it.

### Continued development

I'm really excited to keep learning about frontend technologies, specially about going into javascript in order to create dynamic webs. I want to learn git too because it's important and useful for co-working. I'll working on that when I feel confortable with my HTML/CSS skills.
